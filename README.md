***The data is acquired from https://www.cdc.gov/ on covid 19 vaccinations***

My dashboard is currenlty unavailable, free perks on my Shinyapps.io account were used. I've used multiple datasets, whole bundle size before publishing is around 3.8 GB, I need to purchase the professional plan from Shiny.

I've included the (dashboard)video for demonstration purpose. All necessary files, datasets, pre-requisites and code used to build the dashboard are included in the repository, feel free to take a look.
