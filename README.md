# interactive-vizualizations-using-R

***The data is acquired from https://www.cdc.gov/ on covid 19 vaccinations***

My dashboard is currenlty unavailable, free perks on my Shinyapps.io account were used. I've used multiple datasets, whole bundle size before publishing is around 3.8 GB, I need to purchase the professional plan from Shiny.

Check out this post on **Medium** https://medium.com/@harinathreddy0035/illustrating-insights-the-art-of-visual-storytelling-2756381d8cf8

But, you can still experience the interactive plots and choropleth maps from here  https://vscddg-harinath-mandha.shinyapps.io/vaccine_data_visualization/

I've included the (dashboard)video for demonstration purpose. All necessary files, datasets, pre-requisites and code used to build the dashboard are included in the repository, feel free to take a look.
